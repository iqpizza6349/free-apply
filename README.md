## FreeApply

> No Code Application Builder that to build an apply website.<br>
> 원서 접수 웹 사이트를 기술에 대한 지식 없이 생성할 수 있는 노코드 애플리케이션 빌더

## Why Create FreeApply?

많은 기업들, 조직들이 원서 접수(Apply) 서비스를 필요로 한다는 것을 알았고,
실제로 개발하게될 경우, 상당히 번거롭다는 문제점을 파악하여, 개발하게 되었습니다.

## Tech.

(해당 파트는 라이브러리들이 추가될 때마다 수시로 변할 예정입니다.)
* FastAPI 0.108.0

## How Can you contribute our project?

### Convention

first, you must make issue in github.
second, you make a branch that about that issue.
Each branch name convention is next below.
* feature -> feature-{issue number}
* refactoring -> refactor-{issue number}
* hotfix -> hotfix-{issue-number}
* deploy -> deploy-{version number}-{issue number}
* upgrade -> upgrade-{last issue}-{issue number}

third, you work in your own branch.
fourth, when other contributor make your feature faster then you,
you can change name to "upgrade" branch.

for example, when you made a feature "mail send".
but when other contributor has made a mail send feature first.
and that contributor's issue is "5071", you can change your 
branch name to "upgrade-5071-{your issue number}"

fifth, when you're making or made a new feature that there is no
such of test, you must make a test of your feature.

sixth, when you're feature is not good enough or not good at
our project, It might be deleted in merge step.

seventh, If you do your job done, make PR(pull-request) to 
every contributor can see and review.
And head contributor like me(iqpizza6349) will merge your branch.
